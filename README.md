# C# Object-Oriented Data Model (University System)

This console application is a practical demonstration of Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and data modeling in C#. It uses the familiar concept of a university management system to showcase how to structure an application around complex, interrelated data entities.

**The principles demonstrated here are foundational for any data-intensive field, including BIM, where managing relationships between elements like walls, doors, rooms, and levels is critical.**
